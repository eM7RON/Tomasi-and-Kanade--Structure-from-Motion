The only file which needs to be run is 'main.m' which uses Matlab's cell functionality.

The other files are just auxillary functions which are necessary for main.m to work.

Each function should have a docstring explaining what is does.

I have assumed that the file structure is like that which is obtained by unzipping 
the image data in the folder so have also included the original data in that structure
to save you time.
